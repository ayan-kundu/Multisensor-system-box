# This is an Arduino IDE operational code 
## Hardware used: 
                  Arduino UNO with Adafruit SD card and RTC breakout module 
                  Sensors: 
                          Atlas CO2 industrial sesnor
                          RS 485 Soil probe sensor
                          RS 485 wall mountable Air sensor
                  Battery: 14.4V Li-ion rechargable battery 
## Running Software:
                  The software is customisable and optimised for the microcontroler and its computational capabilities alongside sesnor requirements for proper and robust communication 
                  In Code folder software sketch is included
